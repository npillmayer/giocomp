This example follows the ToDo app in a [Mozialla tutorial for Svelte](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/Svelte_getting_started). We aim to have component code and interaction equally concise as the Svelte example.

Resizing the window reveals the widgets to be somewhat unsophisticated. To be useful in a user-level context more work would have to be put into them. This just shows how much support we get from web browers, HTML and CSS.
